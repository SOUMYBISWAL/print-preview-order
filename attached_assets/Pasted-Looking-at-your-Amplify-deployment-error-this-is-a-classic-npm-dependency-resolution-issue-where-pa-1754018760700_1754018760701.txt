Looking at your Amplify deployment error, this is a classic npm dependency resolution issue where packages are missing from your package-lock.json file. Here's how to fix it:
Quick Fix Steps:
1. Delete and Regenerate Dependencies
bash# Remove lock file and node_modules
rm package-lock.json
rm -rf node_modules

# Clear npm cache
npm cache clean --force

# Reinstall everything fresh
npm install
2. Check Your Package.json
Make sure all AWS SDK dependencies are properly listed. Add any missing ones:
json{
  "dependencies": {
    "@aws-amplify/core": "^5.8.0",
    "@aws-amplify/auth": "^5.6.0",
    "@aws-amplify/api": "^5.4.0",
    "@aws-sdk/types": "^3.0.0",
    "@aws-sdk/eventstream-handler-node": "^3.0.0",
    "@aws-sdk/middleware-eventstream": "^3.0.0"
  }
}
3. Update Amplify Build Configuration
In your Amplify console → App Settings → Build Settings, update the build spec:
yamlversion: 1
backend:
  phases:
    build:
      commands:
        - '# Execute Amplify CLI with the helper script'
        - amplifyPush --simple
frontend:
  phases:
    preBuild:
      commands:
        - npm ci --legacy-peer-deps
    build:
      commands:
        - npm run build
  artifacts:
    baseDirectory: build
    files:
      - '**/*'
  cache:
    paths:
      - node_modules/**/*
4. Alternative: Force Clean Install
If the above doesn't work, try this approach:
bash# Create a .npmrc file in your project root
echo "legacy-peer-deps=true" > .npmrc

# Reinstall
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
5. Environment Variables (if needed)
In Amplify Console → App Settings → Environment Variables, add:

NPM_CONFIG_LEGACY_PEER_DEPS = true
NODE_OPTIONS = --max-old-space-size=4096

6. Commit and Deploy
bashgit add .
git commit -m "Fix npm dependency issues"
git push
Why This Happens:
The error occurs because:

Your package-lock.json is out of sync with your actual dependencies
Some AWS SDK packages have peer dependency conflicts
npm can't resolve the dependency tree properly

The --legacy-peer-deps flag tells npm to use the older, more permissive dependency resolution algorithm, which often resolves these conflicts.
Try the steps in order - usually step 1 alone fixes most cases. If you're still having issues, let me know and I can help you troubleshoot further!
