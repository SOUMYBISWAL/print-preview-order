The AWS Amplify build is failing due to a missing CloudFormation stack for your backend environment. Here's the key error:

csharp
Copy
Edit
[StackDoesNotExistError] Stack does not exist.
‚àü Caused by: [Error] Stack with id amplify-d2h75g2kyk5bz-main-branch-b0c939a96d does not exist
This means Amplify is expecting a backend environment (linked to your app and branch), but it's not found in CloudFormation, which is responsible for managing Amplify backend stacks.

‚úÖ How to Fix This:
üîç Step 1: Confirm App ID and Branch
Make sure the environment variables AWS_APP_ID and AWS_BRANCH are set correctly.

Go to the AWS Amplify console.

Confirm:

App ID matches d2h75g2kyk5bz

Branch you're deploying (e.g., main or dev) actually has a backend deployed.

You can verify this here:
üëâ https://console.aws.amazon.com/amplify/home

üõ†Ô∏è Step 2: Redeploy or Initialize Backend
If no backend was deployed yet for this branch (i.e., you only deployed the frontend), do the following:

Option A: Deploy Backend from Local (if exists)
If your backend (auth, API, etc.) was initialized locally using Amplify CLI:

bash
Copy
Edit
amplify pull --appId d2h75g2kyk5bz --envName main
amplify push
This will recreate the CloudFormation stack for that branch/environment.

Option B: Re-initialize Backend (if needed)
If backend was never set up or got deleted, do:

bash
Copy
Edit
amplify init
amplify add auth       # Or storage / API depending on your use
amplify push
üí° Optional: Remove the npx ampx generate outputs Step
If you're not using the backend in this build yet, you can comment out or remove this line in your Amplify build settings:

perl
Copy
Edit
npx ampx generate outputs --app-id $AWS_APP_ID --branch $AWS_BRANCH --format json --out-dir ./
üîÅ Summary of Solutions
Cause	Fix
Backend stack doesn't exist	Run amplify push to create the backend
Wrong App ID / branch name	Check Amplify console and correct env vars
Backend never initialized	Run amplify init and add required resources
Command unnecessary	Remove ampx generate outputs from build step

If you want, paste your amplify.yml or build settings and I‚Äôll guide you exactly what to edit.
