The deployment error you're facing in AWS Amplify has two main causes, both of which need to be addressed:

‚úÖ 1. Node.js Version Mismatch
Error:
bash
Copy
Edit
npm WARN EBADENGINE Unsupported engine
package: 'lru-cache@11.1.0'
required: { node: '20 || >=22' }
current: { node: 'v18.20.8' }
üí° Explanation:
Your codebase (or some dependencies like lru-cache, react-router@7.7.1, etc.) requires Node.js v20 or higher, but Amplify's default environment is currently using Node.js v18, which causes these EBADENGINE warnings.

‚úÖ Fix:
Set the Node.js version to 20 or higher in Amplify:

In your project root, create or update the .nvmrc file:

Copy
Edit
20
OR, update the amplify.yml to explicitly set the node version:

yaml
Copy
Edit
version: 1
backend:
  phases:
    preBuild:
      commands:
        - nvm install 20
        - nvm use 20
        - npm install
    build:
      commands:
        - npm run build
frontend:
  phases:
    preBuild:
      commands:
        - nvm install 20
        - nvm use 20
        - npm install
    build:
      commands:
        - npm run build
‚úÖ 2. Missing File: amplify_outputs.json
Error:
bash
Copy
Edit
Could not resolve "../../amplify_outputs.json" from "client/src/main.tsx"
üí° Explanation:
Your frontend (likely main.tsx) is importing a file ../../amplify_outputs.json, but this file doesn't exist at the path during build time.

‚úÖ Fix:
Option 1: Check the path:

Make sure amplify_outputs.json exists in your repo.

If it‚Äôs generated dynamically, ensure it's created before the build step.

Option 2: Use environment variables instead:

Instead of importing a .json file, you can pass Amplify outputs as environment variables and access them via import.meta.env (if using Vite).

ts
Copy
Edit
// main.tsx (example)
const apiUrl = import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL;
Then, in Amplify‚Äôs Build settings, add those environment variables.

üîÅ Summary of Fixes
Issue	Fix
Node version too low	Use Node.js v20 in .nvmrc or amplify.yml
Missing amplify_outputs.json	Ensure file exists or switch to environment variables

‚úÖ Recommended Action Plan
Add .nvmrc file with:

Copy
Edit
20
Double-check amplify_outputs.json exists and is accessible during build.

(Optional but better) Refactor to use environment variables instead of importing a JSON file.

Let me know if you want help editing the amplify.yml file or refactoring to use environment variables.
