The error you're seeing during your AWS Amplify backend build phase:

csharp
Copy
Edit
[StackDoesNotExistError] Stack does not exist.
Caused by: [Error] Stack with id amplify-d2h75g2kyk5bz-main-branch-b0c939a96d does not exist
üîç Root Cause:
This means the CloudFormation stack (which holds your Amplify backend infrastructure) does not exist or was deleted, but the build process is trying to reference it.

‚úÖ How to Fix It
‚úÖ Option 1: Verify App ID and Branch
Make sure the --app-id and --branch you're using in:

bash
Copy
Edit
npx ampx generate outputs --app-id $AWS_APP_ID --branch $AWS_BRANCH --out-dir .
‚Ä¶are correct and the backend exists for that branch in the Amplify Console.

Steps:

Go to AWS Amplify Console.

Check your app using the App ID (d2h75g2kyk5bz).

Ensure the branch main exists and has a backend environment configured.

If not, create a new backend environment using the Amplify CLI or Console.

‚úÖ Option 2: Reinitialize Backend Environment
If the stack was accidentally deleted or corrupted, recreate it:

Run this from your local project directory:

bash
Copy
Edit
amplify init
(or, if already initialized)

bash
Copy
Edit
amplify env add
Choose the same app ID and branch (main) during setup.

Then push it:

bash
Copy
Edit
amplify push
Commit and push your changes so Amplify picks them up in CI/CD.

‚úÖ Option 3: Disable npx ampx generate outputs in Build Spec
If you're using npx ampx generate outputs manually in your Amplify build phase and it‚Äôs not essential for your deployment, comment or remove it from amplify.yml until backend is restored.

üõ† Optional: Use Correct Build Settings (amplify.yml)
Double-check your amplify.yml file used by Amplify Console. It should only include npx ampx generate outputs if the backend is valid.

Here's a minimal example:

yaml

version: 1
backend:
  phases:
    build:
      commands:
        - '# Skipping ampx if backend does not exist'
        - echo "Backend build step..."
frontend:
  phases:
    preBuild:
      commands:

    build:
      commands:
        - npm run build
