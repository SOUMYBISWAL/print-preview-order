The final error you're hitting now is:

🔴 Error:

CustomerError: Artifact directory doesn't exist: dist/public
💡 Root Cause:
Your amplify.yml file is configured to expect the frontend build output to be in dist/public, but your actual build output goes to dist/.

This mismatch causes Amplify to fail when trying to find the output folder to deploy.

✅ Fix:
🔧 Option 1: Fix amplify.yml
Update your amplify.yml file's artifact output path from:

yaml
Copy
Edit
artifacts:
  baseDirectory: dist/public
➡️ to:

yaml
Copy
Edit
artifacts:
  baseDirectory: dist
Full example:

yaml
Copy
Edit
version: 1
frontend:
  phases:
    preBuild:
      commands:
        - npm ci
    build:
      commands:
        - npm run build
  artifacts:
    baseDirectory: dist
    files:
      - '**/*'
  cache:
    paths:
      - node_modules/**

# Optional: keep if needed
customHeaders:
  - pattern: '**/*'
    headers:
      - key: 'Cache-Control'
        value: 'no-cache'
📁 Option 2: Fix Build Output Location (if dist/public is intentional)
If your app was supposed to output into dist/public (e.g., nested structure), update your build script to do that.

For example, change vite.config.ts like this:

ts
Copy
Edit
export default defineConfig({
  build: {
    outDir: 'dist/public',
  },
});
But this is usually unnecessary unless you're doing something custom.

🟡 Bonus Warnings to Review

❗ Custom Headers Deprecation:

Edit
[DEPRECATION WARNING] using amplify.yml to modify custom headers is being deprecated.
✅ Fix: Move header settings into a separate customHttp.yml file.
More info: Amplify Docs - Custom Headers

✅ Summary of Fix Steps:
✔ Update amplify.yml → set baseDirectory: dist instead of dist/public

✔ Push the change to your repository

✔ Let Amplify rebuild and deploy

✅ (Optional) Migrate custom headers to customHttp.yml

Let me know if you'd like me to help generate the fixed amplify.yml based on your full stack (React + Vite + Express), or if you need to move the headers to the new format.
