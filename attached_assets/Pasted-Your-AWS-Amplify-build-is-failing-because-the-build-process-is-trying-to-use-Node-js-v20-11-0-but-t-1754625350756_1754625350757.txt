Your AWS Amplify build is failing because the build process is trying to use Node.js v20.11.0, but that version isn’t installed in the Amplify build environment.

The key lines are:

# Executing command: nvm use 20.11.0
N/A: version "v20.11.0" is not yet installed.
You need to run `nvm install 20.11.0` to install and use it.
[ERROR]: !!! Build failed
Why this happens
Amplify doesn’t automatically install arbitrary Node versions.
If your .nvmrc or amplify.yml says 20.11.0, but Amplify's environment doesn’t already have it, the build will stop unless you explicitly tell it to install that version.

How to fix
You have two main options:

Option 1 — Use a Node version Amplify already supports
Go to the AWS Amplify supported runtimes docs and check available Node versions (e.g., 20.x, 18.x, 16.x).

Update your .nvmrc or package.json engines section to a supported version like:

20
or in package.json:

json

Edit
"engines": {
  "node": "20"
}
Redeploy.

Option 2 — Install your required Node version in amplify.yml
If you must use 20.11.0, modify your amplify.yml so Amplify installs it during build:

yaml

Edit
version: 1
frontend:
  phases:
    preBuild:
      commands:
        - nvm install 20.11.0
        - nvm use 20.11.0
        - npm install
    build:
      commands:
        - npm run build
  artifacts:
    baseDirectory: dist
    files:
      - '**/*'
  cache:
    paths:
      - node_modules/**/*
This ensures nvm install runs before trying to use the version.

From your logs, I also notice:

## No backend environment association found, continuing...
This means your Amplify app has no backend linked — so only the frontend will deploy.
That’s fine if your app is static or your backend is hosted elsewhere, but if you expected backend resources, you’ll need to connect the Amplify environment via the Amplify CLI (amplify init → amplify push) before deployment.

If you want, I can prepare a corrected amplify.yml for your project so Amplify installs the right Node version and builds without errors.
