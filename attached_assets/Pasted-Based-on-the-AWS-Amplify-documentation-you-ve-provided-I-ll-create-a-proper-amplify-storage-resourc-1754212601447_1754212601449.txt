Based on the AWS Amplify documentation you've provided, I'll create a proper amplify/storage/resource.ts configuration file for your backend storage setup.Amplify Storage Resource ConfigurationCode import { defineStorage } from '@aws-amplify/backend';

export const storage = defineStorage({
  name: 'amplifyTeamDrive',
  access: (allow) => ({
    // Public files - accessible to all users (guests and authenticated)
    'public/*': [
      allow.gNow you'll also need to update your amplify/backend.ts file to include the storage configuration:Amplify Backend ConfigurationCode import { defineBackend } from '@aws-amplify/backend';
import { auth } from './auth/resource';
import { storage, documentsBucket, backupBucket } from './storage/resource';

defineBackend({
  auth,
  storage,
  // Uncomment the lines below if you want This configuration provides:
Main Storage Bucket Features:

Public Files (public/*) - Anyone can read, authenticated users can write/delete
Profile Pictures (profile-pictures/{entity_id}/*) - Public viewing, only owner can modify
Picture Submissions (picture-submissions/*) - Community upload area
Protected Files (protected/{entity_id}/*) - Authenticated users can read, only owner can modify
Private Files (private/{entity_id}/*) - Only owner has access
Documents (documents/{entity_id}/*) - Personal document storage with read access for other authenticated users
Media Files (media/*) - General media storage
Shared Folder (shared/*) - Collaborative space for authenticated users

Optional Additional Buckets:

Documents Bucket - Dedicated for document storage
Backup Bucket - For backup purposes

Access Levels Explained:

allow.guest.to(['read']) - Unauthenticated users can read
allow.authenticated.to(['read', 'write', 'delete']) - Signed-in users have full access
allow.entity('identity').to([...]) - Only the file owner (based on their identity ID) has access

Next Steps:

Create the folder structure: amplify/storage/resource.ts
Update your amplify/backend.ts file
Run npx ampx sandbox to test locally
Commit and push to deploy: git commit -am "add storage backend" && git push

The {entity_id} placeholder will be automatically replaced with the user's identity ID when they upload files, ensuring proper file isolation between users.
