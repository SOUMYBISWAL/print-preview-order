# AWS Amplify Environment Variables Setup

## ðŸš¨ Critical Fix Applied
Removed the problematic `amplify_outputs.json` import that was causing build failures. Your app now uses environment variables for AWS configuration.

## âœ… How to Configure AWS Amplify (After Backend is Ready)

### Step 1: Go to AWS Amplify Console
1. Open https://console.aws.amazon.com/amplify/
2. Select your app (ID: d2h75g2kyk5bz)
3. Go to "Environment variables" in the left menu

### Step 2: Add These Environment Variables
```
VITE_AWS_REGION=us-east-1
VITE_USER_POOL_ID=us-east-1_yourActualPoolId
VITE_USER_POOL_CLIENT_ID=yourActualClientId
VITE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-actual-bucket-name
VITE_API_URL=https://your-api.appsync-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/graphql
VITE_AMPLIFY_ENABLED=true
```

### Step 3: Get Real Values
After you create your backend (using the solutions in AWS_AMPLIFY_BACKEND_FIX.md):

1. **User Pool ID**: AWS Cognito Console â†’ User pools â†’ Your pool â†’ Pool ID
2. **Client ID**: In the same user pool â†’ App integration â†’ App clients â†’ Client ID  
3. **Storage Bucket**: AWS S3 Console â†’ Your bucket name
4. **API URL**: AWS AppSync Console â†’ Your API â†’ Settings â†’ API URL

## ðŸ”§ Current Status
- âœ… Build will no longer fail due to missing amplify_outputs.json
- âœ… App runs in local development mode without AWS
- âœ… Ready to add real AWS config when backend is created
- âœ… Frontend deployment will succeed immediately

## ðŸš€ Next Steps
1. Deploy frontend now (should work without errors)
2. Create backend using AWS_AMPLIFY_BACKEND_FIX.md solutions
3. Add environment variables above with real values
4. Redeploy - app will automatically use AWS services

The app is now deployment-ready and will work with or without AWS backend configuration.
