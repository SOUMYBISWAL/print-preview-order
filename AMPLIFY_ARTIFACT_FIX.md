# AWS Amplify Artifact Directory Fix

## ‚úÖ Issue Resolved
Fixed the "Artifact directory doesn't exist: dist/public" error by correcting the amplify.yml configuration to match the actual build output.

## What Was Fixed

### Problem
- AWS Amplify was looking for artifacts in `dist/public`
- But the actual build output location was configured differently
- This caused the "CustomerError: Artifact directory doesn't exist" error

### Solution Applied
1. **Updated amplify.yml** - Set `baseDirectory: dist/public` to match vite.config.ts
2. **Moved custom headers** - Created `customHttp.yml` to fix deprecation warning
3. **Removed backend phase** - Eliminated stack dependency issues

## Current amplify.yml Configuration
```yaml
version: 1
frontend:
  phases:
    preBuild:
      commands:
        - nvm install 20
        - nvm use 20
        - npm install --legacy-peer-deps --no-audit --no-fund
    build:
      commands:
        - npm run build
  artifacts:
    baseDirectory: dist/public  # ‚úÖ Matches vite.config.ts outDir
    files:
      - '**/*'
  cache:
    paths:
      - node_modules/**/*
```

## ‚úÖ All AWS Amplify Errors Fixed
