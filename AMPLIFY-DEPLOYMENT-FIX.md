# AWS Amplify Deployment Fix

## Problem
AWS Amplify deployment fails due to npm dependency resolution issues where packages are missing from package-lock.json file.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Updated amplify.yml Configuration
- Force regeneration of package-lock.json during build
- Enable legacy peer deps to resolve dependency conflicts  
- Clean npm cache before installation
- Added proper npm flags to suppress audit and funding messages

### 2. Created .npmrc Configuration
```
legacy-peer-deps=true
audit=false
fund=false
```

### 3. Environment Variables to Add in Amplify Console
Go to: **App Settings â†’ Environment Variables** and add:
```
NPM_CONFIG_LEGACY_PEER_DEPS=true
NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=4096
NPM_CONFIG_AUDIT=false
NPM_CONFIG_FUND=false
NODE_ENV=production
CI=true
```

### 4. Improved Build Script
- Enhanced build-frontend.js with better error handling
- Added memory optimization for Node.js
- Creates mock amplify_outputs.json if needed
- Verifies build output before completion

## Current Configuration

The amplify.yml now:
1. Installs specific Node.js version (20.19.0)
2. Removes corrupted package-lock.json
3. Cleans npm cache completely
4. Installs dependencies with legacy peer deps
5. Runs optimized frontend build

## Next Steps
1. Commit these changes to your repository
2. Add environment variables in Amplify Console
3. Trigger new deployment

The configuration addresses the exact npm dependency resolution issues described in the troubleshooting guide.
