# PrintLite AWS Deployment Solution

## Current Status
✅ **Application Running**: Your PrintLite app is successfully running on port 5000
✅ **Frontend Complete**: All UI components and pages are working
✅ **Backend Configured**: AWS Amplify backend files are properly set up
❌ **AWS Deployment**: S3 bucket creation blocked by credential issues

## The Issue
The AWS credentials you provided appear to be temporary session tokens (starting with "ASIA") that are either expired or missing the required AWS_SESSION_TOKEN. This is preventing the deployment of the S3 bucket needed for file uploads.

## Solution Options

### Option 1: Fix AWS Credentials (Recommended)
Get fresh, permanent AWS credentials:

1. **Go to AWS IAM Console** → Users → Your User → Security Credentials
2. **Create Access Key** → Choose "Application running outside AWS"
3. **Copy the new credentials**:
   - AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID (starts with "AKIA")
   - AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
   - AWS_REGION (e.g., "ap-south-1")

4. **Update Replit Secrets** with the new credentials
5. **Run deployment**:
   ```bash
   cd amplify && npx ampx sandbox --once
   ```

### Option 2: Manual S3 Setup
If you prefer to set up S3 manually:

1. **AWS S3 Console** → Create Bucket
2. **Bucket Name**: `printlite-storage-bucket`
3. **Region**: `ap-south-1` (or your preferred region)
4. **CORS Configuration**: Enable file uploads from web browsers
5. **Bucket Policy**: Allow public read access if needed

### Option 3: Alternative Storage Solution
Use a different file storage service:
- **Cloudinary**: Image and document management
- **Uploadcare**: File uploading and processing
- **Firebase Storage**: Google's file storage solution

## What Happens After Deployment
Once the S3 bucket is created:
- File uploads will work immediately
- Users can upload PDFs, images, and documents
- Files are securely stored in your AWS S3 bucket
- The app will show upload progress and success/error states

## Testing the Fix
After deployment, test:
1. Go to `/upload` page
2. Try uploading a PDF or image
3. Verify file appears in "Uploaded to S3 Storage" section
4. Check AWS S3 Console to confirm files are stored

Your app is ready to go - it just needs the storage backend deployed!
