npm run dev
```

### 2. AWS Amplify Hosting (Frontend-Only) âœ… Ready for Deployment
- **Status**: Configured and ready
- **Backend**: Uses existing APIs or can be configured with external backend

- **Features**: Responsive UI, file handling, order management (with backend API)

**Deployment process:**
1. Connect GitHub repository to AWS Amplify
2. Configure build settings using provided `amplify.yml`
3. Set environment variables in Amplify Console
4. Deploy automatically on push to main branch

**Required Environment Variables:**
- `VITE_API_URL` - Your backend API URL
- Optional: AWS Cognito/GraphQL variables if using full AWS stack

### 3. AWS Amplify Gen 2 (Full Stack) ðŸš§ Configured

3. Deploy backend: `npx ampx sandbox` (dev) or `npx ampx deploy` (prod)
4. Configure frontend environment variables
5. Deploy frontend via Amplify Hosting

## Current Recommendation

**For immediate deployment**: Use AWS Amplify Hosting (Option 2)
- Fastest to deploy
- No backend configuration required
- Can connect to existing Replit backend or any external API
- Full frontend functionality preserved

## Build Configuration

The project includes optimized build configurations:

- **Development**: `npm run dev` - Full-stack local development
- **Production**: `npm run build` - Frontend + backend bundle
- **Frontend-only**: Builds static React app for hosting

## File Structure for Deployment

```
dist/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/           # Static frontend assets
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index.html   # Main HTML file
