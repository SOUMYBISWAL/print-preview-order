# AWS Credentials Issue - Solution Required

## Problem
The AWS credentials you provided are **invalid or expired**. This is preventing the creation of the S3 storage bucket needed for file uploads.

**Error Details:**
- `InvalidAccessKeyId`: The AWS Access Key doesn't exist in AWS records
- `UnrecognizedClientException`: Security token is invalid
- Keys starting with "ASIA" are temporary session tokens that may be expired

## Immediate Solution Needed

**You need to provide fresh, permanent AWS credentials:**

1. **Go to AWS Console** → IAM → Users → [Your User] → Security Credentials
2. **Create New Access Key** (not temporary session token)
3. **Provide these in Replit Secrets:**
   - `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` (should start with "AKIA", not "ASIA")
   - `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` 
   - `AWS_REGION` (e.g., "ap-south-1")

## Required AWS Permissions
Your AWS user needs these permissions:
- S3 bucket creation and management
- IAM role creation
- CloudFormation stack operations
- Systems Manager (SSM) parameter access

## Once Fixed
After providing valid credentials, I can:
1. Deploy the Amplify backend automatically
2. Create the S3 bucket for file storage
3. Enable full file upload functionality

## Current Status
- ✅ Application is running perfectly
- ✅ UI is fully functional
- ❌ File uploads blocked by missing S3 bucket
- ❌ AWS deployment failing due to invalid credentials

**The app is ready - it just needs valid AWS credentials to deploy the storage backend.**
