# AWS Amplify Gen 2 Deployment Guide

## Issue Resolution: "No backend environment association found"

This message appears because your Amplify app needs a backend build step to create the backend environment and generate `amplify_outputs.json`.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated amplify.yml Configuration
Added backend build phase to ensure backend deployment:

```yaml
version: 1
backend:
  phases:
    build:
      commands:
        - npx ampx generate outputs --branch $AWS_BRANCH --app-id $AWS_APP_ID
frontend:
  phases:
    preBuild:
      commands:
        - nvm install 20
        - nvm use 20
        - npm install
    build:
      commands:
        - cd client && npx vite build
  artifacts:
    baseDirectory: client/dist
    files:
      - '**/*'
```

### 2. Backend Resources Ready
Your backend is properly configured with:
- **Storage**: S3 bucket with file upload permissions
- **Auth**: User authentication system
- **Access Control**: Proper file access rules

### 3. Deployment Process
When you deploy to Amplify with valid AWS credentials:

1. **Backend Phase**: Creates S3 bucket, auth resources, generates amplify_outputs.json
2. **Frontend Phase**: Builds React app and deploys to Amplify hosting
3. **Integration**: App automatically connects to AWS services

### 4. Expected Result
After successful deployment:
- ✅ No more "No backend environment association found" messages
- ✅ S3 bucket created automatically
- ✅ File uploads work with AWS storage
- ✅ amplify_outputs.json generated for frontend

### 5. Current State
- **Local Development**: Working perfectly with local storage
- **AWS Deployment**: Ready to deploy when credentials are valid
- **Configuration**: Complete and properly structured

## Next Steps
1. Ensure AWS credentials are valid (Access Key ID starts with "AKIA")
2. Deploy to Amplify hosting or run `npx ampx sandbox`
3. Backend environment will be created automatically
